SPEN is an open source solver for checking validity of entailments 
between formulas in the 'symbolic heaps' fragment of Separation Logic 
with recursive definitions representing complex list segments. 
For this edition, SPEN will compete on the following recursive definitions:
sll0a, nll0a, nlcl0a, skl3.

The solver is based on a method defined in [TR] which reduces the 
entailment checking to the membership problem in tree automata, 
problem dealt using VATA. The reduction relies on checking 
satisfiability (with MINISAT) of boolean formulas built from the 
formulas in the entailment.

The input of SPEN is a file in the SMTLIB2 format.
The output of SPEN is 
- UNSAT for valid entailment
- SAT for invalid entailment (+ a diagnosis)
- UNKNOWN for unsupported logic.
